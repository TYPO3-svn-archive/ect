=== What does this extension do? ===

The target of this extension to install a defined set of libraries and basic extensions all at once. 
For now this is done by the use of dependencies.

=== What is in the set of extensions? ===

The extensions that will be installed are libraries and basic extensions that other extensions can
be build upon. All this extensions are maintained by members of the Extension Coordination Team.

=== What is the target of this extension? ===

The target of this extension and one target of the Extension Coordination Team at all, is to establish
a set of coordinated libraries as base for extension development. It want's to give some orientation 
in the jungle of the many libraries within the TER.

=== Why should I use this libraries? ===

The included libraries have active maintainers or even a team of maintainers. So you will find support
within the newsgroups. The libraries are coordinated so that they fit together as much as it is possible.

=== Are the listet extensions stable? ===

Well that but be nice. But it's not the primarly target to include only stable extensions. We also 
want to set the focus upon extensions that need the support of the community to become stable soon.

=== Why should I install this extension? ===

You don't need to install this extension. If you install it,  it's for your own curiosity. Maybe 
you want make it a habit to build your extensions upon this fundament. In this case it helps you to 
get started more quickly with the installation of the funcamental extensions.

=== Why isn't my library in this set of extensions? ===

Your extension must meet the requirements of ECT extensions (See below). You must be an active member 
in the extension coordination newsgroup/mailinglist. Simply putting an extension into the TER is not enough, 
even if your extension is perfectly coded. The regular communication with the other developers is a prerequest.


== Requirements for extensions ==

# The maintainer of the extension needs to be an active member of the ECT. He participates in the 
discussions in the NG typo3.teams.extension-coordiantion and answers to the daily questions. 
Maybe there is an own mailinglist for the extension.

# The extension should be a base for other extensions. Either it is a library or it is an 
extension of fundamental functionality that other extensions build upon. It is not the place 
for extensions that are only build for end users.

# The extension can also provide end user functionality for the TYPO3 BE that is interesting for
many people but still didn't find it's way into the set of core extensions.

# There shouldn't be concurrency within this set of extensions. I.e. there should only be one
basic calendar extension.

# The extension keys don't start with a personal prefix but have a general name. Underscores
Should be avoided.

# The extension must meet the coding guidlines and quality standards of TYPO3.


== Addons: ECT syntax for extension keys (*) ==

''(*) The syntax is based on a voting from spring 2007 in typo3.teams.extension-coordination.''

The extension key kickstarter__mvc shows how keys for addons should look like.

Every few weeks somebody programms a new calendar extension from scratch because he needs 
a special feature, that is missing in all existing calendar extensions. Certainly his calendar 
is missing other features again and the next calender is started. The amount of calendars in 
TER is rather of harm than of use. 

The recommended way is to have one base calendar (cal) and to add new features when needed. 
Best you add the feature togther with the maintainer. But that often keeps theory. 
If you need to do it in form of an own extension for any reason, 
we recommend to do it in form of an addon. Addons have a special syntax for the keys. 
The namepart of your addon is appended to the extension key of the basis by use of 
double underscores. 

 Example: cal + extraviews => cal__extraviews 

Addons can be done recursively: 

 Example: cal__extraviews + part1=> cal__extraviews__part1

We plan to modify TER in a way, that addons can be directly listed below the extension. 
This way you get an overview quickly.
